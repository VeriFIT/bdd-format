# bdd-format
Proposal for a standard format for BDDs and their variations.

See the [examples](examples/).

## todo
* should we have an order on the nodes in the file? E.g., endpoints of edges can only be previously defined nodes (this corresponds to building the DD from the leaves upwards)
* allow multiple (named) roots in one file?
